# Catalog-Assignment-Solution

Steps to solve the Problem:
1. We will use the following formula to compute the Constant:
    c=  (−r_1 )(−r_2 )⋯(−r_k )
 => c = (−1)^k (r_1 * r_2 *.. * r_k )

2. Using the Base with Values given in the json format, we will compute the r values.
3. For the test case 1, we have
     k=3, 𝑐 = −(4 * 7 * 12)
      c = −336
